<div id="progress"></div>

<!-- ================= QUESTIONS START HERE ================= -->

<!-- QUESTIONS WILL BE INSERTED IN BLOCKS -->
 <!-- Question 1 -->
<div class="question">
  <p><strong>1)	Which of the following could be an expected finding in a lower motor neuron lesion?</strong></p>

  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, true)">Fasciculations</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Pronator Drift</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Spastic Paralysis</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Hyperreflexia</button>

  <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
    <p>Fasciculations are a hallmark LMN lesion sign. They are rapid, involuntary muscle twitches under the skin that are too weak to move the limb but can be felt by the patient and seen by others. Other LMN signs include hyporeflexia, hypotonia, flaccid paralysis and marked muscle atrophy.</p>

<p>Pronator drift is when supinated, extended arms pronate when the eyes close and are a sign of UMN lesion of the corticospinal tract.</p>

<p>Hyperreflexia is seen in UMN lesion. Hyporeflexia is seen in LMN lesion.</p>
 

<p>Spastic paralysis is seen in UMN lesion. This is where muscles are stiff and tight, instead of floppy and weak in flaccid paralysis (LMN lesion).</p>
  </div>
</div>


<!-- Question 2 -->
<div class="question">
  <p><strong>2)	Which of the following is most likely to cause a Trendelenburg Gait?</strong></p>

  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, true)">Superior Gluteal Nerve Palsy</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Decrease in dopamine in the Basal Ganglia</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Common Peroneal Nerve Injury</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Basilar Artery Stroke</button>

  <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
    <p>A Trendelenburg Gait is where the pelvis is tilted to one side whilst walking. This occurs in weak hip abductor muscles (gluteus medius and minimus) and the pelvis drops to the contralateral side. The superior gluteal nerve supplies these two muscles, and therefore a LMN will cause weakness and a Trendelenburg gait.</p>
    <p>A decrease in dopamine in the Basal Ganglia describes Parkinson’s. Parkinson’s has a distinct “shuffling” gait as opposed to a tilted hip.</p>
    <p>An injury to the common peroneal nerve would cause foot drop and a high steppage gait. This is because it weakens the dorsiflexors of the foot.</p>
    <p>A basilar artery stroke would cause much more severe symptoms than a gait. Basilar artery stroke can cause locked in syndrome where there is complete paralysis apart from vertical eye movements and blinking.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<!-- Question 3 -->
<div class="question">
  <p><strong>3)	A 25 year old woman is brought into hospital by her university after physically attacking a teacher. She claims that God has chosen her to fight off evil spirits. Her parents, who she lives with, mention that she has not slept in 5 days but has been extremely energetic and irritable during this period. They said this was strange as she seemed very passive beforehand. When questioned, she speaks very loudly and jumps rapidly between topics that seem disjointed.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Which diagnosis aligns with her history?</strong></p>

  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, true)">Mania</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Schizophrenia</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Hypomania</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Schizoaffective disorder</button>

  <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
    <p>The correct answer is a manic episode as she has required hospitalisation and has grandiose delusions. She has classic symptoms of bipolar disorder with an elevated mood, increased energy, decreased need for sleep, pressured speech and a flight of ideas. This would be bipolar disorder type 1.</p>
    <p>Although the symptoms are < 1 week, this is not hypomania because she has required a hospitalisation and there is evidence of grandiose delusions. </p>
    <p>Schizophrenia requires >6 months of symptoms and the mood symptoms do not align with the classic negative symptoms of schizophrenia.</p>
    <p>Schizoaffective disorder requires a period of at least 2 weeks of psychosis without mood symptoms, to then develop significant mood episodes. There is no evidence of this in the vignette. </p>
  </div>
</div>

<!-- Question 4 -->
<div class="question">
  <p><strong>4)	She is treated for an acute episode of mania with 2.5mg IM haloperidol. 
Which of the following is NOT a potential complication of haloperidol?
</strong></p>

  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Cardiac Arrhythmia</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Parkinsonism</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, true)">Serotonin Syndrome</button>

  <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
   <p>Haloperidol is a first generation (typical) antipsychotic. It’s mechanism of action is antagonism of overactive D2 receptors in the mesolimbic system.</p>

<p>This can cause side effects such as Parkinsonism (where there is a deficiency of dopamine in the basal ganglia).</p>

<p>Haloperidol also increases the QT interval, potentially causing Torsade’s de Pointes (a type of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia)</p>

<p>Haloperidol also increases risk of NMS. Recall that NMS presents as fever, tachycardia, altered mental status, increased tone (lead pipe rigidity) and rhabdomyolysis. Because it causes rhabdomyolysis, one of the primary ways to confirm NMS is to check for serum creatine kinase.</p>
<p>Serotonin syndrome is not primarily caused by typical antipsychotics, it is instead caused by SSRI’s, SNRI’s, MAOIs and illicit drugs such as ecstasy, cocaine, meth and LSD. The clue is in the name – drugs that increase serotonin cause serotonin syndrome. Haloperidol primarily affects dopamine.</p>
<p>Serotonin syndrome causes fever and tachycardia like NMS but presents with tremor, myoclonus and GI symptoms like diarrhoea. It also has an onset within 24 hours compared to NMS which develops over days to weeks.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<!-- Question 5 -->
<div class="question">
  <p><strong>5)	A 6 month old child presents with an abnormally large head and a prominent, bulging forehead.  MRI reveals herniation of the cerebellar tonsils and myelomeningocele.</strong></p><p><strong> Which type of Chiari Malformation does this describe?</strong></p>

  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Chiari Malformation Type 1</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, true)">Chiari Malformation Type 2</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Chiari Malformation Type 3</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Chiari Malformation Type 4</button>

  <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
    <p>This is Chiari Malformation Type 2 or Arnold-Chiari Malformation. Herniation of the cerebellar tonsils has occurred due to spina bifida decreasing the CSF pressure, herniating the cerebellar tonsils. Almost always associated with myelomeningocele and causes hydrocephalus if the foramen magnum gets blocked.</p>
<p>Chiari malformation type 1 is a downward displacement of the medulla and herniation of the tonsils only, found in teens/adults.</p>
<p>Chiari malformation type 3 is further herniation of the cerebellum forming an encephalocele.</p>
<p>Chiari malformation type 4 is hypoplasia or aplasia of the cerebellum due to spina bifida. Type 3 and 4 are very rare.</p>

</div>
</div>

<!-- Question 6 -->
<div class="question">
  <p><strong>6)	A primigravida woman (pregnant for the first time) with a history of epilepsy comes into the GP asking about her anticonvulsant medications. Which of the following anticonvulsants are suitable for her?</strong></p>

  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Phenytoin</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Sodium Valproate</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, true)">Lamotrigine</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Carbamazepine</button>

  <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
    <p>Lamotrigine is considered safe in pregnancy. The other main pregnancy antiepileptic is levetiracetam.</p>
<p>Sodium Valproate is known to cause birth defects due to folate antagonism and other pathways.</p>
<p>Carbamazepine is contraindicated in pregnancy as it increases risk of birth defects compared to safer options like lamotrigine and levetiracetam.</p>
<p>Phenytoin is also associated with congenital defects, most notably fetal hydantoin syndrome which presents as cleft lip, wide set eyes and a flat nasal bridge. It can also cause heart defects.</p>

</div>
</div>

<!-- Question 7 -->
<div class="question">
  <p><strong>7)	An 18 year old male comes into the GP mentioning that he has had a low mood nearly every day for the past year and wishes to start on antidepressants. He is struggling to find fun in hobbies he used to enjoy and has struggled to sleep, finding himself waking up early in the morning. He says he has had thoughts of self-harming but never followed through. He denies suicidal ideations.</strong></p><p><strong> What is the most appropriate management?</strong></p>

  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Deny antidepressant therapy due to drug seeking behaviour</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, true)">Prescribe sertraline with routine review after 1 week </button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Prescribe sertraline with routine review after 6 weeks </button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Prescribe amitriptyline with routine review after 6 weeks</button>

  <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
    <p>The history here is consistent with depression. There is a persistent low mood > 6 months, anhedonia and sleep disturbances. SSRI’s such as sertraline are firstline if the patient wants to be on medication.</p>
<p>NICE guidelines recommend a checkup after 1 week for 18-25 year olds and/or those who are at risk of suicide. This is because SSRI’s increase suicide risk days 4 to 9 of treatment initiation. They typically take 4 to 6 weeks to work.</p>
<p> Review after 6 weeks is incorrect because an initial review is recommended within 2-4 weeks across all other ages.</p>
<p>Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant. These are normal second/third-line.</p>
<p>There is no sign of drug seeking behaviour and there is no evidence that antidepressants are currently not classed as addictive. The patient has a right to state his preferences in his treatment plan.</p>

</div>
</div>

<!-- Question 8 -->
<div class="question">
  <p><strong>8)	Which type of dementia has risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes and has a step wise progression of disease?</strong></p>

  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, true)">Vascular Dementia</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Lewy Body Dementia</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Alzheimer’s Disease</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Frontotemporal Dementia</button>

  <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
<p>Vascular dementia has risk factors such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, IHD, stroke/TIA history, obesity, smoking and diabetes. It has a varied, stepwise progression as microinfarcts and vascular events cause worsening dementia bit by bit.</p>

<p>Lewy Body dementia is infamous for a more rapid decline in cognition. It presents with sleep, mood, visual hallucination and parkinsonism disorders before significant memory loss.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease risk increases with things such as hearing loss and genetic risk factors such as APP, PSEN1, PSEN2 and Down’s syndrome.</p>


</div>
</div>

<!-- Question 9 -->
<div class="question">
  <p><strong>9)	A 21 year old rugby player receives IV ketamine during the emergency reduction of an anterior shoulder dislocation. 
</strong></p><p><strong>What is the mechanism of action of this anaesthetic?
</strong></p>

  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">GABA-A agonist</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">AMPA receptor blocker</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, true)">NMDA receptor blocker</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Dopamine Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitor</button>

  <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
    <p>Ketamine acts as a non-competitive antagonist of NMDA. NMDA is an ionotropic glutamate receptor that allows the influx of Ca2+, Na2+ and K+.</p>

<p>AMPA receptor blockers include the anticonvulsant perampanel. AMPA is another ionotropic glutamate receptor.</p>

<p>GABA-A agonists include benzodiazepines, barbiturates, Z-drugs, propofol and alcohol.</p>

<p>Note that the muscle relaxant baclofen targets GABA-B instead.</p>

<p>Examples of DNRIs include bupropion (atypical antidepressant), methylphenidate (Ritalin, ADHD drug).</p>


  </div>
</div>

<!-- Question 10 -->
<div class="question">
  <p><strong>10)	An 84 year old man comes into the hospital after a fall. Examination reveals 1/5 strength and a loss of sensation in the right lower limb. The left lower limb and upper limbs appear normal. He has intact speech and has not noticed any changes to his vision. Which artery is most likely to have been affected?</strong></p>

  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Right Middle Cerebral Artery</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Right Anterior Cerebral Artery</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Left Middle Cerebral Artery</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, true)">Left Anterior Cerebral Artery </button>

  <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
    <p><strong>Correct answer: Left Anterior Cerebral Artery </strong></p>
    <p>It must be a left sided stroke as the contralateral side is affected.</p>
    <p>A middle cerebral artery stroke is more likely to cause problems with vision and hemiparesis and numbness in the upper limb and face too. The pertinent negatives rule this out.</p>
    <p>An anterior cerebral artery infarct is more likely to affect the lower limb over the upper limb.</p>
    
  </div>
</div>
<!-- Question 11 -->
<div class="question">
  <p><strong>11)	Which of the following Parkinson’s drugs do NOT improve the efficacy of levodopa?</strong></p>

  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Entacapone</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, true)">Ropinirole</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Carbidopa</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Selegiline</button>

  <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
    <p>Ropinirole is a direct dopamine agonist. It works independently of levodopa and therefore does not affect its efficacy.</p>

<p>Entacapone is a COMT inhibitor (Catechol-O-methyltransferase). COMT breaks down levodopa into 3-OMD. Other examples include tolcapone and opicapone.</p>

<p>Selegiline is an MAO-B inhibitor (monoamine oxidase B). MAO-B breaks down dopamine in the brain. Other examples include rasagiline and safinamide</p>

<p>Carbidopa is a DDC inhibitor (Dopamine decarboxylase). DDC breaks down levodopa into dopamine outside the blood brain barrier. Dopamine can’t pass the blood brain barrier, only L-DOPA can.</p>

</div>
</div>

<!-- Question 12 -->
<div class="question">
  <p><strong>12)	A 71 year old woman with stage 4 breast cancer has metastases to the bone. The tumour is compressing the left side of the spinal cord at the level of T9-T10 and the consultant identifies Brown-Sequard syndrome after a physical examination.</strong></p><p><strong>Which of the following examination findings align with this diagnosis?</strong></p>

  
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Weakness in the left lower limb, loss of all sensation in the lower right limb</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Weakness in the right lower limb, loss of fine touch, vibration and proprioception in the lower left limb</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Weakness in both the left and right lower limbs, loss of pain and temperature sensation in the lower left limb</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, true)">Weakness in the left lower limb, loss of fine touch, vibration and proprioception in the left lower limb, loss of pain and temperature sensation in the lower right limb</button>

  <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
    <p>Brown Sequard syndrome is most commonly caused by penetrating trauma but can also be caused by infection, tumours, ischemia, spinal disc herniation and transverse myelitis (e.g. from MS). Recall this is an incomplete spinal cord injury where the spinal cord is hemisected, but it presents paradoxically because of where the spinal tracts decussate.</p>

<p>The Corticospinal tract has already decussated in the pyramids in the medulla, so remain ipsilateral. Therefore, there is ipsilateral weakness/paralysis (left side).</p>

<p>The DCML (Dorsal Column Medial Lemniscus) has already decussated in the medulla so there is ipsilateral loss of fine touch, proprioception and vibration (left side).</p>

<p>The Spinothalamic tract decussates at the level of the spinal cord, so is yet to decussate. Therefore, there is contralateral loss of pain and temperature (right side)</p>

</div>
</div>

<!-- Question 13 -->
<div class="question">
  <p><strong>13)	A 61 year old woman with well-controlled schizophrenia is being treated with haloperidol for the past 3 months. She complains to the GP of involuntary, repetitive movements of her hands, tongue and face muscles that are extremely frustrating. The GP observes her lip-smacking during the consultation. </strong></p><p><strong>What movement disorder is she experiencing?</strong></p>

  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, true)">Tardive Dyskinesia</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Hemiballismus</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Essential tremor</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Chorea</button>

  <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
   <p>This is tardive dyskinesia. It is caused by the dopamine antagonism from haloperidol and the “tardive” means delayed, which is why it has taken 3 months to appear. Other symptoms she is likely to experience from dopamine antagonism are akathisia (restlessness) and acute dystonia (sudden, painful, sustained contractions). The treatment of persistent tardive dyskinesia is VMAT2 inhibitors such as tetrabenazine.</p>

<p>Hemiballismus is one sided involuntary flinging limb movements caused by a stroke affecting the subthalamic nucleus.</p>

<p>Essential tremor is a rhythmic shaking of the hands, especially during movement. It often runs in families and is a diagnosis of exclusion. Treatment involves propranolol.</p>

<p>Chorea is erratic, jerky and unpredictable limb movement most notably caused by Huntington’s disease.</p>

<p>The involuntary movement disorders can be hard to remember and categorise. Luckily, they are low yield after this semester.</p>

 </div>
</div>

<!-- Question 14 -->
<div class="question">
  <p><strong>14)	Appendicitis can refer pain to the umbilical (bellybutton) region due to its embryological origin in the midgut. This occurs because the brain interprets visceral appendix pain as somatic dermatome pain from the same spinal segment. </strong></p><p><strong>What is the dermatome supplying the umbilical (bellybutton) area?</strong></p>

  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">L4</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">T8</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, true)">T10 (OPG) acts to reduces bone resorption by inhibiting the activation of osteoclasts</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">L1</button>

  <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
    <p>T10 is the associated dermatome for the bellybutton. You can remember this by remembering bellybut(ten). Other important dermatomes are thumb (C6) and nipple (T4). Eventually you will need to learn (almost) all of them for examinations.</p>

<p>L4 is the vertebral level of the umbilicus.</p>

 </div>
</div>

  <p><strong>15)	Which of the following conditions is most likely to cause an absence of a red reflex?</strong></p>

  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">Optic Neuritis</button>

  <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
    <p>Cataracts are clouding of the lens due to protein accumulation. This directly hinders the red reflex which is the reddish glow when light shone on the pupil reflects off the retina.</p>

<p>Strabismus is a squint and will not occlude this light; there is a normal red reflex</p>

<p>Glaucoma is probably the next best answer. Severely increased intraocular pressure may alter the red reflex but cataracts are much more likely.</p>

<p>Optic neuritis is inflammation of the optic nerve and does not affect the retina or ocular media, so there is a normal red reflex.</p>

<p>Other conditions that will affect the red reflex include retinal detachment, retinoblastoma and vitreous haemorrhage. Many people picked glaucoma for this question in my year, probably because we hadn’t really been taught about cataracts.</p>

<!-- Question 16 -->
<div class="question">
  <p><strong>16)	When a muscle receives an action potential at the neuromuscular junction, Ca2+ is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytoplasm in order to initiate muscle contraction. This then returns to the sarcoplasmic reticulum for storage.

  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, true)">SERCA pump</button>

  <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
    <p>SERCA stands for Sarco/Endoplasmic Reticulum Calcium ATPase. This actively pumps Ca2+ back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum against the concentration gradient for storage.</p>

<p>Ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are like the opposite of SERCA and release calcium into the cytoplasm from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Clinically relevant in malignant hyperthermia, a reaction to certain general anaesthetics (like halothane) and muscle relaxants (like succinylcholine) where RyR’s allow too much calcium out, causing excess muscle contraction and high body temperatures. Reversed by dantrolene.</p>

<p>T-tubules are invaginations of sarcolemma (muscle cell membrane) that allow ions such as Ca2+ to enter deep into the muscle cell. However, they are separate from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.</p>

<p>GABA-A are ligand gated Cl- channels found mainly throughout the CNS</p>

  <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
    <p>This is Wernicke’s Aphasia, where speech flows easily but lacks meaning. The patient may not realise they are speaking nonsense.</p>

<p>Broca’s aphasia is difficulty initiating speech. Comprehension and understanding is usually intact, but sentences are strained, short and halted. This is a very frustrating form of aphasia, whereas Wernicke’s aphasia can present with a content person.</p>

<p>Conduction aphasia is an issue with the arcuate fasciculus connecting Wernicke’s and Broca’s areas and presents with poor ability to repeat words and phrases despite relatively good comprehension and spontaneous speech.</p>

<p>Global aphasia is the most severe form where speech is both nonfluent and impaired in meaning, comprehension and repetition. Reading and writing are also likely to be impaired.</p>

  <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
    <p>This is otitis media with effusion due to the retracted membrane and thick effusion, both secondary to negative pressure in the middle ear due to eustachian tube dysfunction. This is different to acute otitis media because it is post-infection and he is afebrile. This causes conductive hearing loss and pain which can explain the mother’s findings.</p>

<p>Otitis externa is infection and inflammation of the outer ear canal, causing pain worse with tugging.</p>

<p>Meniere’s disease presents with a triad of vertigo, tinnitus and sensorineural hearing loss. It is secondary to increased endolymph pressure and is rare in children.</p>

  <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
    <p>Rheumatoid arthritis can cause anaemia. The diagnosis is clear with the morning stiffness, autoimmune panel and elevated markers. The mechanism is complex but important. Hepcidin is released by the liver in RA due to inflammation (it is an acute-phase protein). Hepcidin inhibits Ferroportin. Ferroportin normally releases iron from storage in macrophages, hepatocytes and enterocytes (gut cells). When inhibited, less iron is released into the bloodstream to make RBC’s, causing anaemia.</p>
    <p>Iron deficiency anaemia is incorrect. I tried to mislead you with the risk factor of vegetarianism, but her MCV and Ferritin are normal. </p>
    <p>Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia is incorrect. Nothing aligns with AIHA apart from a normal MCV. You would expect jaundice, low haptoglobin, high LDH.</p>
    <p>Methotrexate does cause folate deficiency and is also firstline in rheumatoid arthritis. However, her MCV would be elevated.</p>

    <p>Presbycusis is age-related hearing loss, particularly of the high frequencies.</p>
    <p>Hypermetropia can also be age related but just means long-sightedness. It is a refractive error where images are focused behind the retina and age can cause it as the lens stiffens, making it harder to focus on close-up objects.</p>
    <p>Tympanosclerosis is scarring of the tympanic membrane due to repeated ear infections, injuries or surgeries. This causes conductive hearing loss.</p>
    <p>Otosclerosis is the abnormal bone growth around the stapes footplate. Consequently, this causes fixation of the stapes and conductive hearing loss. Typically starts in young adulthood and has a notable drop-off at 2000Hz known as a Carhart Notch on an audiogram. </p></div>

  <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
    <p>Stevens Johnson syndrome is a severe skin reaction presenting with fever, painful skin blistering and peeling caused by medications or infections. The most notable causes are anticonvulsants (carbamazepine, lamotrigine, phenytoin) and antibiotics (sulfamethoxazole, penicillins, cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones). There is normally a positive Nikolsky sign where gentle pressure still causes skin peeling to reveal the dermis. SJS is on a spectrum where there is <10% total skin loss. This becomes toxic epidermal necrolysis when >30% of the body surface loses skin.</p>
    <p>Anaphylaxis is rapid, hypersensitive, IgE-mediated, mast cell and basophil granulation. It would instead present with shock, smooth muscle contraction and airway obstruction as well as skin changes. Positive Nikolsky sign should not be seen.</p>
    <p>Drug Hypersensitivity syndrome is the delayed immune mediated reaction to medications characterised by fever, rash, swollen lymph nodes and blood and liver abnormalities. Although it can be caused by anticonvulsants, the Nikolsky sign should be negative.</p>
    <p>Bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune disease that targets hemidesmosomes where large tense blisters appear across different areas on the skin, preceded by itchy rashes. Normally occurs in the elderly and treatment includes steroids and immunosuppressants. </p>

    <p>The man demonstrates hemi-spatial neglect which is usually due to a unilateral lesion to the right parietal lobe, or the temporo-parietal junction. Sense of direction and spatial awareness is also a primary role of the parietal lobe. This is most likely to be caused by the stroke which then doubles the risk of dementia.</p>
    <p>Occipital lobe damage is normal described with visual changes and difficulty with recognition. </p>
    <p>Frontal lobe damage presents with loss of executive function, decision making and personality changes. Changes to speech such as Broca’s aphasia can also occur.</p>

   <p>A subarachnoid haemorrhage is classic for sudden “worst ever” thunderclap headache. Sometimes not detected on CT so an LP is done 12 hours after onset if suspected. Xanthochromia (yellow CSF from blood breakdown) is a positive finding.</p>
    <p>Initial loss of consciousness, then a period of alertness before rapid deterioration of mental status describes the lucid interval of an epidural haematoma as the expansion of blood creates a mass effect and an increase in ICP (intracranial pressure)</p>

  <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
   <p>The diagnosis is multiple sclerosis. MS is an autoimmune condition that has flares disseminated in space and time. Multiple white plaques on MRI indicate dissemination in space. Dissemination in time is likely with the fall in visual acuity 4 months ago (likely optic neuritis) and the shocks on flexion of the neck is Lhermitte’s sign indicating demyelination of the spinal cord, classic of MS.</p>
    <p>Oligoclonal bands are inflammatory markers that can be found after lumbar puncture in MS and can be a useful diagnostic tool. However, they don’t diagnose MS alone. </p>
    <p>Hypotonia of the lower limbs does not occur because MS affects UMNs. Hypertonia occurs instead. Symmetrical hypotonia can occur in Guillain Barre Syndrome.</p>
    <p>Central lung opacity in CXR as well as neurological symptoms could indicate a small cell lung cancer causing Lambert Eaton Syndrome as a paraneoplastic syndrome. You’ll consider this a differential next year. </p>

  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">CNVIII</button>
  <button class="option" onclick="selectAnswer(this, false)">CNX</button>

  <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
    <p>This is a very tricky question because although the cochlear branch of CNVIII is responsible for hearing, CNVIII palsy causes sensorineural hearing loss, not hyperacusis (louder noises). </p>
    <p>Additionally, although CNV palsy could theoretically cause hyperacusis as it supplies the tensor tympani muscle (tensing the tympanic membrane to dampen loud sounds), it is a rare cause. Instead, tensor tympani hyperacusis is normally triggered by an excessive contraction from acoustic shock (loud noise), stress, anxiety, trauma or eustachian tube dysfunction. </p>
    <p>CNVII is far more likely to cause hyperacusis due to the loss of innervation to the stapedius muscle. The stapedius muscle dampens the Stapes’ vibrations and this palsy is much more common. This is often seen in Bell’s Palsy.</p>

  <div class="feedback" style="display:none;">
    <p>This is a tricky neuroembryology question. The prosencephalon is the embryonic precursor of the forebrain that turns into the telencephalon and diencephalon. The telencephalon forms the cerebrum, and the diencephalon forms all of the thalamus’s: the thalamus, hypothalamus and epithalamus</p>
    <p>The Mesencephalon forms the midbrain</p>
    <p>The Rhombencephalon forms the hindbrain. This consists of the metencephalon structures (pons and cerebellum) and the myelencephalon (medulla oblongata)</p>
    <p>The myelencephalon is thus developed from the rhombencephalon and does not form the thalamus.</p>

<p>Honestly the only reason I added this question is because it came up when I did the Sem 3 exams. You can imagine how pissed and confused we all were. </p>
    <p>They obviously never taught us but there are 3 clinically important brain herniation syndromes: (low yield)</p>
    <p>1)	Transtentorial herniation – where the medial temporal lobe (especially the uncus) herniates through the tentorial notch (the free inner edge of the cerebellar tentorium) so it goes downwards. This presents with a triad of an ipsilateral, unresponsive “blown” pupil, contralateral hemiplegia and decreased level of consciousness.</p>
    <p>2)	Central herniation – where the brainstem becomes downwardly displaced. Kind of similar to Chiari malformation but those are congenital. This can cause pupil changes and Cushing’s triad (irregular respiration, bradycardia, hypertension) due to brainstem compression</p>
    <p>3)	Subfalcine herniation – Where the cingulate gyrus herniates under the falx cerebri (essentially one side of the brain crossing the midline). This can compress the anterior cerebral artery and cause an ACA stroke.</p>
    <p>Chiari Malformation Type 4 is congenital hypoplasia and aplasia of the cerebellum due to spina bifida. </p>

    <p>The oculomotor nerve supplies all extraocular muscles apart from the superior oblique (which primarily depresses the eye) and lateral rectus (which abducts the eye). Therefore the eye will be depressed and abducted i.e. down and out.</p>
    <p>Difficulty looking downwards is seen in trochlear nerve palsy as weakness in the superior oblique causes difficulty depressing, abducting and intorting the eye. This presents as head tilting and a classic “double vision when walking down stairs”</p>
    <p>Esotropia (inwards) is often seen in abducens nerve palsy.</p>
